Uhm. I'll have the Veggie Tacos please, and some extra salsa.
I'll do it in half an hour.
Are you sure you want to do... That one?
This contest is a breeze.
This burrito is driving you insane.
Snap out of it!
Why don't we get a job?
Could you split it between four cards?
How did this happen?
Dude, don't worry, just leave it up to me.
I'm losing my mind back here.
The nerve of that guy!
Let's stack up!
What's the deal? Where'd he go?
We'll be right there.
He'll be back soon.
This is the greatest thing I've ever eaten.
Let me taste it.
It can't be that good, you know?
Oh, be still my heart.
This hive turns out gallons and gallons of honey every day.
I'm gonna go take a nap.
I gotta go and charge my phone again.
How hard can it be, huh?
Keep up the good work.
I'm just not as strong as I thought I was.
That's a big deal.
This is tough.
My brain! It's it's too cold!
We've never had anything like it.
I'll get you something else to eat.
What is he saying?
Why are you so persistent in this ramen biz?
Do you guys do refills?
Cut it out!
I'm not really cut out for this kind of work.
Let me help!
Got anything on you?
Dude, what's up with this guy?
We need to get him somewhere, though.
We'll leave everything here for you two.
What are you gonna do with us?
This might take a while.
I'm counting on you.
Don't embarrass me.
I've got an even better job for you guys.
like I'm encased in this cold prison of fear.
How did these guys get their money?
Keep'em coming!
Our calzones are legit!
We'd like to say, "Our bad."
You're driving away all the customers!
It's a long story.
How did it go?
If everything goes according to plan…
How's your food?
What did you get?
The service here is terrible!
His Korean really sucks.
I think I'm coming down with the flu.
There is a flu going around these days.
I have to finish this by 2 o'clock.
You'd better not mess with me.
That movie really sucked.
I come from a large family.
That's my dream job!
I gotta turn this steam down.
You gotta help me.
I'm sure we can figure this out.
Maybe if I mess with these buttons, steam's pressure will get us out of here.
This room's in a frightful mess.
He's got a chip on his shoulder.
Let's all chip in and buy him a nice present.
I don't hold a grudge.
Get over it!
It's time for you to move on.
You really hurt my feelings.
I'll never forget what you said.
That was a close call.
We just missed it.
Why aren't you taking my calls?
She stood me up.
Don't keep me waiting.
Don't string him along like that.
What do you usually do in your free time?
I didn't have the heart to tell him.
How did he take the news?
He took it well.
He didn't bat an eye.
Just my luck!
Serves you right!
That's what you get!
It's your fault.
I told you so!
I really blew it this time.
Epic fail!
I heard you were quitting.
It looks like you're finally getting the hang of it.
Everyone's jumping on the bandwagon.
Looks like you're off the wagon, huh?
I quit cold turkey.
I'm turning over a new leaf.
That's what I'm saying.
That's what I'm talking about.
You took the words right out of my mouth!
It's a fresh start.
That's not a good sign.
Third time's the charm!
I'm all ears!
Don’t interrupt!
The thing is…
You're not very understanding.
Thanks for your understanding.
The damage is done!
That ship has sailed.
She's very high maintenance.
They worked it out.
Stay focused!
I’ve been trying to stay out of trouble.
Stay out of my business.
Mind your own business.
Do you mind if I use this?
No wonder you speak English so well.
I’ve got a lot on my mind right now.
I’ve got a lot on my plate.
That’s what I love about Korea.
That’s what I hate about working here.
That’s just the way it is.
Don’t badmouth me!
I heard you were talking trash.
Don’t talk about me behind my back!
Don’t spread rumors!
