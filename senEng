Uhm. I'll have the Veggie Tacos please, and some extra salsa.
I'll do it in half an hour.
Are you sure you want to do... That one?
This contest is a breeze.
This burrito is driving you insane.
Snap out of it!
Why don't we get a job?
Could you split it between four cards?
How did this happen?
Dude, don't worry, just leave it up to me.
I'm losing my mind back here.
The nerve of that guy!
Let's stack up!
What's the deal? Where'd he go?
We'll be right there.
He'll be back soon.
This is the greatest thing I've ever eaten.
Let me taste it.
It can't be that good, you know?
Oh, be still my heart.
This hive turns out gallons and gallons of honey every day.
I'm gonna go take a nap.
I gotta go and charge my phone again.
How hard can it be, huh?
Keep up the good work.
I'm just not as strong as I thought I was.
That's a big deal.
This is tough.
My brain! It's it's too cold!
We've never had anything like it.
I'll get you something else to eat.
What is he saying?
Why are you so persistent in this ramen biz?
Do you guys do refills?
Cut it out!
I'm not really cut out for this kind of work.
Let me help!
Got anything on you?
Dude, what's up with this guy?
We need to get him somewhere, though.
We'll leave everything here for you two.
What are you gonna do with us?
This might take a while.
I'm counting on you.
Don't embarrass me.
I've got an even better job for you guys.
like I'm encased in this cold prison of fear.
How did these guys get their money?
Keep'em coming!
Our calzones are legit!
We'd like to say, "Our bad."
You're driving away all the customers!
It's a long story.
How did it go?
If everything goes according to plan…
How's your food?
What did you get?
The service here is terrible!
His Korean really sucks.
I think I'm coming down with the flu.
There is a flu going around these days.
I have to finish this by 2 o'clock.
You'd better not mess with me.
That movie really sucked.
I come from a large family.
That's my dream job!
I gotta turn this steam down.
You gotta help me.
I'm sure we can figure this out.
Maybe if I mess with these buttons, steam's pressure will get us out of here.
This room's in a frightful mess.
He's got a chip on his shoulder.
Let's all chip in and buy him a nice present.
I don't hold a grudge.
Get over it!
It's time for you to move on.
You really hurt my feelings.
I'll never forget what you said.
That was a close call.
We just missed it.
Why aren't you taking my calls?
She stood me up.
Don't keep me waiting.
Don't string him along like that.
What do you usually do in your free time?
I didn't have the heart to tell him.
How did he take the news?
He took it well.
He didn't bat an eye.
Just my luck!
Serves you right!
That's what you get!
It's your fault.
I told you so!
I really blew it this time.
Epic fail!
I heard you were quitting.
It looks like you're finally getting the hang of it.
Everyone's jumping on the bandwagon.
Looks like you're off the wagon, huh?
I quit cold turkey.
I'm turning over a new leaf.
That's what I'm saying.
That's what I'm talking about.
You took the words right out of my mouth!
It's a fresh start.
That's not a good sign.
Third time's the charm!
I'm all ears!
Don’t interrupt!
The thing is…
You're not very understanding.
Thanks for your understanding.
The damage is done!
That ship has sailed.
She's very high maintenance.
They worked it out.
Stay focused!
I’ve been trying to stay out of trouble.
Stay out of my business.
Mind your own business.
Do you mind if I use this?
No wonder you speak English so well.
I’ve got a lot on my mind right now.
I’ve got a lot on my plate.
That’s what I love about Korea.
That’s what I hate about working here.
That’s just the way it is.
Don’t badmouth me!
I heard you were talking trash.
Don’t talk about me behind my back!
Don’t spread rumors!
Make your mind up!
You deserve it
Don't dwell on
Stand me up
Soft boiled egg
Have a crush on
Do your worst!
Out of the blue
Puzzle out!
Period
We're grounded for two months.
That settle it
manly man
They all went in cahoots to swindle me.
I wasn't whispering
Don't cross the line.
Can I take you home?
Don't tell on me.
How dare you put my pot on.
Call it even
Holy smokes!
I have a wide circle.
Do you often doze off in classes?
Nutcase
They had forged a bond.
Take off your coat.
How many days did you take off?
Keep your coat on.
He lay wakeful all night.
Nail up!
Suit yourself
It's no use trying to butter me up.
He is a heartless man.
I think we're lost.
I think this is it.
I think this is enough.

Do you like this?
Do you have a car?
Do you have enough?
Do you want more?
Do you want to go out?
Do you come here often?
Are you done?
Are you alone?
Are you leaving?

Easy does it
Either will do

Give it a rest
Gladly
Go fifty-fifty
Go ahead
I'm touched
I'm all set
I'm aware of that
I'm exhausted
I'm stuffed
I'm short-changed
I can't afford that
I mean it
I can't say for sure
I didn't mean to
I don't get it
I haven't got all day
I was told that
I will do it for you
I will drink to that
Act your age
Back me up
Back it in
Better late than never
Catch up!
Can't argue with that
Can you drop me downtown?
Can't(Couldn't) be better than this
Cash or charge?
Didn't I make myself clear?
Charge it please
Do I know it?
Don't push it(your luck)
Don't mess with me
Don’t rub it in
Easy, easy!
Enough is enough
Far from it!
For good?

Give me a break~
Grow up!
Hang in there
Hang loose
Hold it! (Hold your horses!)
He's a handful
I blacked out
I'm dead set against it
I'm near-sighted
I'm on duty
I can tell
I can't thank you enough
I doubt it
I've had it!
I know what!
I made it!
I taught myself
I'll be in touch
I wouldn't say no
It's muggy
I've got to get going
each to one's own
It's now or never
It's on me
It wouldn't hurt to try
Just about
Keep in touch
Keep it to yourself
Keep out of my way
Keep your chin up!
Knock it off
Know your place
Let me get this straight
Let's thumb a ride
Let's give him a big hand!
Let's go by the book!
Look who is here
Luck you!
Lie on your back
Lie on your stomach
Make a way!
I'd like to speak to '누구'
Who is calling?
Who am I talking to?
This is '누구'
Did you want to see me?
I can't hear you well
Please hold on

This is so degrading
You only gotta embrace
easy for the messy one to say
Why does this have 20 million views?
I guess that's true
Hamsters are huge right now
Enough of all this!
I guess we can give it a shot
How 'bout this one?
How many zeros we have?
We're never gonna find somewhere to live!
What're you waiting for?
You guys go on ahead. I'll catch up
I guess that's how I started out, too
Feast your eyes on this baby
They're all the rage
I've got a bunch of stuff to mail
Clean as a whistle
Now what are we gonna do?
I don't know what's going on
I'll be outside
Hold tight, amigos. I got it
Check out what we got
What happened to your old phone, anyway?
